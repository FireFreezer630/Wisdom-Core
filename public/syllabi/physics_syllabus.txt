INTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF PRACTICAL WORK [cite: 206]
Candidates will be asked to carry out experiments for which instructions will be given. [cite: 206] The experiments may be based on topics that are not included in the syllabus but theoretical knowledge will not be required. [cite: 207] A candidate will be expected to be able to follow simple instructions, to take suitable readings and to present these readings in a systematic form. [cite: 208] He/she may be required to exhibit his/her data graphically. Candidates will be expected to appreciate and use the concepts of least count, significant figures and elementary error handling. [cite: 209]
Note: Teachers may design their own set of experiments, preferably related to the theory syllabus. [cite: 210] A comprehensive list is suggested below: [cite: 211]

1. Lever There are many possibilities with a meter rule as a lever with a load (known or unknown) suspended from a point near one end (say left), the lever itself pivoted on a knife edge, use slotted weights suspended from the other (right) side for effort. [cite: 211] Determine the mass of a metre rule using a spring balance or by balancing it on a knife edge at some point away from the middle and a 50g weight on the other side. [cite: 212] Next pivot (F) the metre rule at the 40cm, 50cm and 60cm mark, each time suspending a load L or the left end and effort E near the right end. [cite: 213] Adjust E and or its position so that the rule is balanced. [cite: 214] Tabulate the position of L, F and E and the magnitudes of L and E and the distances of load arm and effort arm. [cite: 215] Calculate $MA=L/E$ and VR = effort arm/load arm. [cite: 216] It will be found that MA <VR in one case, $MA=VR$ in another and MAVR in the third case. [cite: 216] Try to explain why this is so. Also try to calculate the real load and real effort in these cases. [cite: 217]

7. For a ray of light incident normally ($i_1=0$) on one face of a prism, trace course of the ray. [cite: 222] Measure the angle $\delta$. Explain briefly. Do this for prisms with $A=60^{0}, 45^{0}$ and $90^{0}$. [cite: 223]

8. Calculate the specific heat capacity of the material of the given calorimeter, from the temperature readings and masses of cold water, warm water and its mixture taken in the calorimeter. [cite: 224]

Teachers may feel free to alter or add to the above list. [cite: 228] The students may perform about ten experiments. [cite: 228] Some experiments may be demonstrated. [cite: 229]

EVALUATION [cite: 229]
The practical work/project work are to be evaluated by the subject teacher and by an External Examiner. [cite: 229] (The External Examiner may be a teacher nominated by the Head of the school, who could be from the faculty, but not teaching the subject in the relevant section/class. For example, a teacher of Physics of Class VIII may be deputed to be an External Examiner for Class X, Physics projects.) [cite: 230]
The Internal Examiner and the External Examiner will assess the practical work/project work independently. [cite: 231]
Award of Marks [cite: 231]
Subject Teacher (Internal Examiner) 10 marks [cite: 231]
External Examiner 10 marks [cite: 231]
(20 Marks) [cite: 231]
The total marks obtained out of 20 are to be sent to CISCE by the Head of the school. [cite: 231]
The Head of the school will be responsible for the online entry of marks on CISCE'S CAREERS portal by the due date. [cite: 232]
